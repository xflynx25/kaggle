Intial Data Vis
    - columns, sizing, data types
    - Nan analysis and coping 
    - column distributions
Baseline Model
    - lasso regression or logistic regression as our quickies
    - use a fraction of the data
Cross Validation
    - get the CV loop implemented
    - baseline SD by changing the seed, this will inform whether to accept feature engineering changes as significant
Improving the Model 
    - try boosting methods 
    - bi-grams, tri-grams, mathematical-grams 
    - blending models 
    - CV on the hyperparameters 
    - throwing out bad features? 
    - NN if called for
