We weren't careful about losing the numerical column information. 
In these tree models, it will not split on the numerical so much. 
Next, we should look into the sizes of these transformed df, and see how we can make sure we still are using those (feature importances mb)

We should do more eda. We can see which features seem of actual importance. 

We can try the method of just putting an ordering on them, since that is equivalent for ROC, actual percentages don't matter 

There is the method of autoencoding the categoricals, we will need to think how we can loss function maybe as function of number of rows you got

And eventually this will probably be good with NN

There is the concern with grossly unbalanced dataset.
